            <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4" style="font-family: Georgia;">
                The bridle paths include both public trails on county-owned property and private trails in Barrington Hills. Over 150 miles of these paths are maintained by the Riding Club of Barrington Hills. Everyone with a Forest Preserve of Cook County tag for their horse and license for the rider can take advantage of the public trails maintained by the Riding Club of Barrington Hills in the Cook County Forest Preserves. Trails located outside the Forest Preserve are for the exclusive use of Riding Club of Barrington Hills members and guests by stipulation of the land owners where these trails are located.

            <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4" style="font-family: Georgia;">
                You must be a member of the Riding Club of Barrington Hills to ride our private bridle paths.    Your current year trail tag must be displayed at all times when riding.   Trails are for mounted horseback riders only.   Walkers, joggers, dogs on or off leash, ATVS, golf carts, driving horses, horses pulling carriage, hand walking horses, ponying horses, bicycles, sleds, skis, snowmobiles, etc. are not allowed on our private trails and is considered trespassing.
                <br><br>
                A guest may only ride the trails if accompanied by a Riding Club member.   Any guest on the trail must sign a waiver form prior to riding.   It is the responsibility of the host Riding Club member to insure that the form is filled out and mailed in to the Riding Club.   The waiver can be signed online <a class="text-blue-500" href="/waiver">here</a>.
                <br><br>
                Our trail representatives maintain the trails and serve as ambassadors to those whose properties we ride across.
                <br><br>
                For questions about the private horse trails, or to find out how you can permanently deed an easement to the Riding Club, please contact the RCBH Vice President or send us a message from our <a class="text-blue-700" style="font-family: Georgia;" href="/contactus">Contact Us</a> page found under the Main menu.
